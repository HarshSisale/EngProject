                        <p> Scythe Curie, or more commonly known as the "Grand Dame of Death", was also an apprentice of Scythe Faraday many decades before Citra and Rowan were even born.
                            Scythe Curie, after she accepts Citra as her apprentice, taught her everything she knew as a scythe, and prepared her to eventually become one. However when Scythe Anastasia(Citra) and Scythe Curie travel to endura,
                            the scythedom capitol upon a manmade island that floats in the water, Scythe Goddard (A "New Order Scythe" that is obsessed with becoming all powerful amongst the scythes) finds a way to sink the entire island, with them and Scythe Lucifer(Rowan) still stuck on it.
                            Scythe Curie makes a difficult decision, by sealing Scythes Anastasia and Lucifer in an airtight steel box, in the hopes that they can be revived later after the island sinks. She then gleans all the people trapped on the island, giving them the mercy of dying painlessly,
                            rather than drowning or being eaten by sharks. She then self-gleans with her only regret being that she wouldn't be able to see the day Scythe Anastasia gets revived. This was her greatest moment because she showed leadership and immense selflessness.
