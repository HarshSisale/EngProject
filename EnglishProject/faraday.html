                        <p> Scythe Faraday was a respected scythe that had many apprentices including, Scythe Curie, Scythe Anastasia, and Scythee Lucifer. 
                            Scythe Faraday was described as a logicial and understanding scythe, who always mourned the people that he selected for gleaning.
                            Unfortunatly at a meeting between all of the scythes in America, it would be decided that because Scythe Faraday took 2 apprentices, that only
                            one should be able to be ordained as a scythe. This leads Scythe Faraday to fake his own death and go into hiding in order to release
                            Citra and Rowan from his apprenticeship. This situation is further worsened when citra and rowan instead get assigned new mentors, Scythe Curie and Scythe Goddard respectively.
                            Many years later, after doing lots of research, Scythe Faraday with the help of a rejected scythe named Munira, found the island which the original founding scythes hid a fail-safe in. The fail-safe was in 
                            case the scythedom was becoming corrupted, which it was with scythe Goddard muniplating the other scythes into seeing things from his point of view. Faraday however, was still
                            stuck on the island, and had no way of accessing the bunker because it required two scythe rings to activate, which he could access after citra got revived
                            and traveled to meet him on the island. They discovered that the bunker was hiding spaceships, and an automatic gleaning system that would glean 20% of the population with diseases every 5 years, which made the scythedom and 
                            scythes unnecessary. This was his greatest moment because he had found meaning, and accepted that he didn't have to take anymore lives on his own. However he would still conduct "Sympathy Gleanings", where he would mercifully kill
                            the people selected to die every five years.
