                        <p> Citra Terranova, along with Rowan, was selected by Scythe Faraday to become a scythe. They were trained to become 
                            assasins and hitmen, having to research their next gleaning target. However after Faradays self-gleaning, Citra gets a new mentor, Scythe Curie.
                            Scythe Curie taught her to have compassion for all that she gleans, and to trust in her own instinct. Following her advice, Citra decides to investigate 
                            Scythe Faraday's death. She tells Rowan about her findings, but he tells her to discontinue her investigation. Soon after, at the Winter Conclave, Citra is selected to become a scythe,
                            and is ordered to kill Rowan. However, she discreetly gives him immunity to gleaning by punching him in the face and getting some blood on her newly aquired scythe ring.
                            This allows Rowan to escape and eventually become Scythe Lucifer. This is her most defining moment, as it shows how she evolved from a somewhat timid teen, into a courageous and independent
                            Scythe; Scythe Anastasia.
